# movies-search-and-watchlist
I completed Scrimba's Module 9 movie watchlist solo project. I used omdb api to get the movies data and displayed it using html, css and js.
We also had to build the watchlist page, where we added the movies there. Movies could also be removed from the watchlist page too.
Following were the design specs- https://www.figma.com/file/jhFRdFIdHpRxsDznNXtpXw/Movie-Watchlist?node-id=2%3A17&t=NoulranwOIxkGxcY-0

##Functionalities-
Search a movie title and list of movies matches the title is populated for the user. </br>
Select and add a movie to the watchlist page using local storage. </br>
If title is not found then a message to search for different query is displayed </br>
On the watchlist page, remove movies. If no movies left to watch then a button and message is displayed which guides back to the search page. </br>
